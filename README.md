# Wise Ranker

Wise Ranker is a Ruby on Rails application that allows users to rank items dynamically by dragging and reordering them. Each move contributes to a global ranking system, making it ideal for opinion-based ranking, prioritization, or voting systems.

## Features

✅ **Drag-and-drop ranking** – Users can reorder items interactively.  
✅ **Persistent rankings** – Changes are stored in a PostgreSQL database.  
✅ **API-driven** – The app serves JSON for frontend interactions.  
✅ **Real-time updates (Future Enhancement)** – Plans to implement real-time rankings using WebSockets.  
✅ **User authentication (Future Enhancement)** – Planned feature to track rankings per user.
